# Good afternoon po, Sir Oliver. As one of your new students in System Integration and Architecture, I would like to share that this course may not be very familiar to me yet, but I am eager to learn and gain knowledge from you. My expectation is that by the end of the semester, we will be able to carry with us the valuable lessons you have taught. It’s really difficult to take a course without learning much, and we don’t want to experience that again (hehe), and I truly hope that our class will be both meaningful and memorable, and hopefully not too stressful as well. Thank you, Sir
